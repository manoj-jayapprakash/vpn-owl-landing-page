1. must have a static nav bar, such that tapping on the links scrolls to the relevant section on the page.
2. must follow theme of the app as much as possible
3. you are free to use any images from the web as you feel required
4. you can fill in as much lorem ipsum as you want - we are looking for the design and responsiveness, not content writing skills
5. you must implement the following two features as well:
   5a) when the user opens the page, he must be greeted with a floating label with a greeting message as per the time of the day (good morning/good afternoon/good evening/good night). The floating label must disappear after 10 seconds or if a user clicks on the 'X' button.
   5b) the box on the bottom right must be floating as the user scrolls. it should accept a text input. the text input should be a valid hex code which changes the background color of the page as the user types.
   You can refer to this image to see how both the components must look: i.ibb.co/CV80cqP/Components.png
